# learning-malware-analysis
This repository contains sample programs that mimick behavior found in real-world malware. The goal is to provide source code that can be compiled and used for learning purposes, without having to worry about handling live malware or causing real damage to any system. The type of program is organized by concept it is focused on, you can see this through the root folder structure. 

I discuss many of these programs through online videos and courses and you may find the following helpful:

## Compiling the Source Code

These programs are intended to be compiled with the C/C++ compiler from Microsoft. You can use the `Developer Command Prompt` after installing the free/community version to compile using `cl`. An example of this command would be:

```cl <path/to/source_code>```

This should produce two files: `.obj` and `.exe` using the name of the input file. You can typically ignore the `.obj` file, the `.exe` is what you will analyze. Please note, occassionally specific compiler flags are used to obtain desired affects in the resulting binary. These compiler flags will be identified in the related videos or noted in the README in the specific folder.
