# learning-malware-analysis
This repository contains sample programs that mimick behavior found in real-world malware. The goal is to provide source code that can be compiled and used for learning purposes, without having to worry about handling live malware.

If you're looking for real world malware or other interesting artifacts, please check out my repo [malware-samples](https://github.com/jstrosch/malware-samples).
